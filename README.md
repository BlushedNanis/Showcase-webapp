# Showcase Website (Django)

The website was made to be simple to use and minimalistic, with a focus on showcasing projects and user profile. In order to make the website dynamic and simple for the administrator to maintain, it is built using Django models. Additionally, there's a contact form that, when completed, sends an email to both the administrator and the user.

Because Bootstrap 5 is so user-friendly and produces archivable visual results, all of the HTML style is done with it.

## Django models

1.**Profile data****:** intended to have a single entry that allows the administrator to add and modify user profile details.

Fields:

* Name
* Description
* Title
* Extra1
* Extra2
* Image
* Created date
* Updated date

*Note: The two extra fields, extra1 and extra2, are designed to supplement the profile data with additional information and format it according to the administrator's preferences. In this example, I use extra1 to show bullet points and extra2 to add a paragraph below the bullet points.*

2.**Projects data:** Here the administrator can store all the projects to showcase which will be dinamically displayed in the website on 3 columns in a descendent order from the updated date.

Fields:

* Title
* Description
* Link
* Image
* Created date
* Updated date

*Note: Given that the website has a github icon for every project, the link field is intended to be a github link.*

3.**Contact form:** To keep track of them, all completed forms will be kept here.

Fields:

* Name
* Email
* Subject *predefined subjects list*
* Message
* Timestamp
* Email sent
* Email received

*Note: The purpose of email sent and received tracking is to monitor email delivery success and identify any technical issues.*
